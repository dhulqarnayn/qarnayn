# QARNAYN: Maturidiyyah
### WORK IN PROGRESS
The Maturidis are a kalami (philosophical group) based on innovation (bid‘ah); they are named after Abu Mansur al-Maturidi.

In the beginning, their main focus was on using rational and philosophical proof in disputing with their opponents, the Mu‘tazilah, Jahmis and others, in order to prove the fundamentals of Islam and Islamic beliefs.

The Maturidis went through several stages. They were not known by this name until after the death of their founder, just as the Ash‘aris were not known and did not spread until after the death of Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari. We can sum up the stages of development in the following four main stages: 

Origin of the Maturidis

The main focus at this stage was intense debates with the Mu‘tazilah. The prominent figure at this stage was Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, whose full name was Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Maturidi as-Samarqandi; he was named after Maturid, which is a place near Samarkand in Transoxiana, where he was born.

He is regarded as one of the pioneers of the rational school; he did not acquire a great deal of knowledge of Islamic texts and the science of hadith, which is the case with the majority of scholars in the fields of kalam and usul.

Abu Mansur al-Maturidi was influenced by Jahmi beliefs in many ways, the most significant of which was: the interpretation of texts that speak of some of the divine attributes that are classed as sifat khabariyyah (attributes that are based on texts and cannot be proven by rational thought, such as the divine Countenance, Hand and so on) in a manner other than the apparent meaning. He also came under the influence of the innovation (bid‘ah) and ideas of the Murjiah.

He was also influenced by Ibn Kullab (d. 240 AH) and his innovation of the concept of divine “self-talk” (al-kalam an-nafsi)

Development of the Maturidis

This is the stage during which the students of al-Maturidi and those who were influenced by him developed his ideas further, and formed an independent kalami (philosophical) group. The group first appeared in Samarkand, and worked to spread and defend the thought of their shaykh and leader, and wrote books. They followed the madhhab of Imam Abu Hanifah with regard to minor issues of Islam. Thus Maturidi beliefs became more widespread in Samarkand than elsewhere.

Among the most well-known figures during this stage were: Abu’l-Qasim Ishaq ibn Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Hakim as-Samarqandi and Abu Muhammad ‘Abd al-Karim ibn Musa ibn ‘Isa al-Bazdawi.

Consolidation of Maturidi beliefs

The main feature of this stage was prolific writing of books and compiling of evidence on which the Maturidi beliefs were based. Therefore it was the most important stage in terms of consolidating this school of thought.

Among the most important figures during this stage were: Abu’l-Ma‘in an-Nasafi and Najm ad-Din ‘Umar an-Nasafi. 

Expansion and spread of the Maturidis

This is regarded as one of the most important stages, in which the Maturidis reached the peak of their expansion and spread. That was due to the support of the Ottoman sultans. Maturidi dominance spread wherever Ottoman dominance reached. So they spread eastwards and westwards in the Arab lands, India, and the lands of the Turks, Persians and Byzantines.

There were many prominent scholars among them, such as al-Kamal ibn Humam.

The Maturidis spread and the number of followers increased in India and neighbouring Eastern countries, such as China, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They also spread in Turkey, the Byzantine lands, Persia and Transoxiana; they still have a strong presence in these countries.
