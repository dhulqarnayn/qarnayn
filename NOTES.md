  ii. Honestly I shouldn't actually add a disqus chat here.    
  iii. I'm about to add redirects only to [Home](index.md) it's getting a bit too much (unnecessary) work to change EVERY file and release it.    
  iv. about to add an easter egg for Nimari, and our random, bookloving, unseeable visitor that decided to save me one day.

  i. Honestly I have zero clue what I am doing, but I am doing it!    
  ii. I added NOTES.md here. Thinking of adding some Discord server invite links for zero reason whatsoever.

  iv. I changed the style of the website, still changing stuff.    
  v. Added [NOTES](NOTES.md), I'll move some things there and keep it like an archive or just say non-important things there. Perhaps Nimari will see it.    
  vi. Working on adding disqus chats here.
